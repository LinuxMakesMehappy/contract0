# 🎯 FTYP Tokenomics Whitepaper

## Executive Summary

The **Flexible Tiered Yield Protocol (FTYP)** tokenomics model is designed to create a **sustainable, long-term ecosystem** that rewards loyal users while maintaining protocol health through innovative economic mechanisms. Our tokenomics framework combines **immediate liquidity incentives**, **tiered reward systems**, and **penalty-based sustainability** to create a balanced economic model.

### Key Economic Principles
- **Sustainability First**: Protocol must remain profitable regardless of market conditions
- **User Alignment**: Rewards must incentivize long-term participation
- **Liquidity Management**: Immediate liquidity must not compromise protocol health
- **Fair Distribution**: All users must have equal opportunity to earn rewards

### 1.2 Economic Sustainability Formula

```
Protocol Sustainability = (Revenue - Costs) / TVL > Minimum Threshold

Where:
Revenue = Early Exit Penalties + Protocol Fees + Integration Fees
Costs = Gas Fees + API Costs + Development + Marketing
TVL = Total Value Locked in Protocol
Minimum Threshold = 2% annual return for sustainability
```

## 2. Mathematical Framework

### 2.1 Base APY Calculation

#### Core APY Formula
```
Base APY = 17% (Fixed Base Rate)

Tier Multipliers:
- Diamond: 1.5x (25.5% APY)
- Gold: 1.25x (21.25% APY)
- Silver: 1.0x (17% APY)
- Bronze: 0.75x (12.75% APY)

Duration Bonus:
- 1-30 days: 1.0x
- 31-60 days: 1.5x
- 61+ days: 2.0x

Kamino Multiply:
- Enabled: 4.0x
- Disabled: 1.0x

Final APY = Base APY × Tier Multiplier × Duration Bonus × Kamino Multiply
```

#### Mathematical Expression
```
APY = 17% × T(tier) × D(duration) × K(kamino)

Where:
T(tier) = {1.5, 1.25, 1.0, 0.75} for {Diamond, Gold, Silver, Bronze}
D(duration) = min(duration_days / 30, 2.0)
K(kamino) = {4.0, 1.0} for {enabled, disabled}
```

### 2.2 Early Exit Penalty Calculation

#### Penalty Formula
```
Early Exit Penalty = Total Commitment Rewards

Total Commitment Rewards = Stake Amount × Base Rate × Total Duration × Tier Multiplier

Mathematical Expression:
Penalty = S × 0.17 × (T_end - T_start) / 365 × T(tier)

Where:
S = Stake Amount (in SOL)
T_end = Intended End Time
T_start = Stake Start Time
T(tier) = Tier Multiplier
```

#### Example Calculations

**Example 1: 30-Day Commitment, Diamond Tier, 10 SOL**
```
Penalty = 10 × 0.17 × (30/365) × 1.5
Penalty = 10 × 0.17 × 0.0822 × 1.5
Penalty = 0.209 SOL
```

**Example 2: 90-Day Commitment, Gold Tier, 20 SOL**
```
Penalty = 20 × 0.17 × (90/365) × 1.25
Penalty = 20 × 0.17 × 0.2466 × 1.25
Penalty = 1.048 SOL
```

### 2.3 Tier Calculation Algorithm

#### Loyalty Score Formula
```
Loyalty Score = (Amount Score × 2) + (Time Score × 3) + Frequency Score + (Rewards Score × 2)

Where:
Amount Score = Stake Amount (in SOL)
Time Score = Days in Protocol
Frequency Score = Number of Interactions
Rewards Score = Total Rewards Earned (in SOL)
```

#### Tier Assignment
```
Tier Assignment:
- 0-100 points: Bronze
- 101-250 points: Silver
- 251-500 points: Gold
- 501+ points: Diamond
```

### 2.4 APY Redistribution Mechanism

#### Redistribution Pool Calculation
```
Redistribution Pool = Total APY × 20%

Redistribution Distribution:
- Bronze Penalty: 40% of pool
- Silver Penalty: 30% of pool
- Gold Bonus: 20% of pool
- Diamond Bonus: 10% of pool
```

#### Mathematical Expression
```
R_pool = APY_total × 0.20

R_bronze = R_pool × 0.40
R_silver = R_pool × 0.30
R_gold = R_pool × 0.20
R_diamond = R_pool × 0.10

Where:
R_pool = Redistribution Pool
R_tier = Redistribution for specific tier
```

Year 1: 50% (1,000,000 FTYP)
Year 2: 50% (1,000,000 FTYP)
```

#### Community Rewards (Dynamic)
```
Reward Rate = f(TVL, User Count, Protocol Performance)

Daily Rewards = Base Rate × TVL Multiplier × User Multiplier × Performance Multiplier
```

## 4. Revenue & Sustainability Model

### 4.1 Revenue Streams

#### Primary Revenue: Early Exit Penalties
```
Revenue_penalties = Σ(Penalty_i × Early_Exit_Rate_i)

Where:
Penalty_i = Penalty for tier i
Early_Exit_Rate_i = Early exit rate for tier i
```

#### Secondary Revenue: Protocol Fees
```
Revenue_fees = TVL × 0.001 × Completion_Rate

Where:
TVL = Total Value Locked
0.001 = 0.1% protocol fee
Completion_Rate = Percentage of stakes completed without early exit
```

#### Tertiary Revenue: Integration Fees
```
Revenue_integration = Jupiter_Fees + Kamino_Fees

Jupiter_Fees = JupSOL_Volume × 0.0005
Kamino_Fees = Kamino_Volume × 0.001
```

### 4.2 Cost Structure

#### Fixed Costs
```
Fixed_Costs = Development + Marketing + Infrastructure

Development = $50,000/month
Marketing = $30,000/month
Infrastructure = $10,000/month
Total Fixed = $90,000/month
```

#### Variable Costs
```
Variable_Costs = Gas_Fees + API_Costs

Gas_Fees = Transaction_Count × Average_Gas_Price
API_Costs = Jupiter_Calls + Kamino_Calls × Cost_Per_Call
```

### 4.3 Profitability Model

#### Monthly Profit Calculation
```
Monthly_Profit = Monthly_Revenue - Monthly_Costs

Monthly_Revenue = Revenue_penalties + Revenue_fees + Revenue_integration
Monthly_Costs = Fixed_Costs + Variable_Costs
```

#### Break-even Analysis
```
Break_even_TVL = Fixed_Costs / (Revenue_Rate_per_SOL - Variable_Cost_Rate_per_SOL)

Where:
Revenue_Rate_per_SOL = Average revenue generated per SOL staked
Variable_Cost_Rate_per_SOL = Average variable cost per SOL staked
```

## 5. Economic Incentives & Game Theory

### 5.1 User Incentive Structure

#### Long-term Staking Incentives
```
Long_term_bonus = Duration_Multiplier × Tier_Multiplier × Kamino_Multiplier

Duration_Multiplier = min(days / 30, 2.0)
Tier_Multiplier = {1.5, 1.25, 1.0, 0.75}
Kamino_Multiplier = {4.0, 1.0}
```

#### Early Exit Disincentives
```
Early_exit_cost = Total_Commitment_Rewards

This ensures users pay the full opportunity cost of breaking their commitment
```

### 5.2 Tier Progression Incentives

#### Tier Advancement Benefits
```
Tier_Benefits = {
    Diamond: {1.5x APY, 1.2x Penalty, Priority Support, Governance Rights},

    Penalty_Enforcement: Automatic penalty application
}
```

### 5.3 Protocol Sustainability Incentives
